This file contains additional syntax highlighting that I use for my C++11
development in Vim. Compared to the standard syntax highlighting for C++ it
adds highlighting of (user defined) functions and the containers and types
in the standard library / boost.

Development is done at: http://github.com/octol/vim-cpp-enhanced-highlight
